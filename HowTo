Let's get started
Gradle dependencies for: Compose Navigation, Compose ViewModel, Room databaase, Test
add this to Project Gradel - task clean(type: Delete) {
    delete rootProject.buildDir}

Start with DATA where you build Room package with Data Entity first - ShoppingList
annotate with @Entity
annotate the PrimaryKey for table in room (SQLite database)
annotate ColumnInfo to rename the column as "list_id"
SQLite is a relational database design - data stored using tables and data linked together using  relationships
one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many
So, we have a list of custoemrs and we try to connect this list with list of items(carrying item details - id, name, qty)
Create a second table for item details, third table for storeID, and later join these two tables
autoGenerate Primary key in Room

Build DAOs, that will help interact with DB (small caps)
@Dao interface
Do mention @Insert to tell Room to create an impl to insert the data as mentioned in the menthod
here some of the items have the same id, so ensure to avoid conflicts
whenever items have similar id, it will be replaced with a new one
We use sus fun because we want to ensure that these DAO methods do not use the mainThread
